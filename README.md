This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and sponsored by [radio.de](https://radio.de).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
